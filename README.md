# Termux-Battery ðŸ”‹

## About
Termux-Battery is a Bash script that monitors and displays your device's battery status in Termux. It retrieves battery percentage, temperature, and charging status using `jq` and `termux-battery-status`. The script also supports various options to customize the output, including:
- Adjusting the battery frame color with a 256-color value.
- Centering the output horizontally.
- Disabling ASCII art to show only battery data.
- Emulating battery level, status, and temperature.
- Running in a loop with 0.5-second intervals.
